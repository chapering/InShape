1. What Is Contained/Available with This Tool
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This tool includes three executables as follows:

. singleitr
	the single DTI streamtube model render, it serves to visualize a single DTI
	data model.

	An example of the most commonly used scenario of this tool might be:
	./singleitr -f ~/dtidata/normal/normal_s1.data

	if you want to apply the 2D skeletonic projection to assist your 3D
	exploration, you need to further indicate where the skeleton geometry is by
	using the "-s" option like:
	./singleitr -f ~/dtidata/normal/normal_s1.data -s ~/dtidata/normal/skeleton/normalSkeleton_s1.data

	if you want to load DWI b0 image as reference, please indicate the slice
	directory with "-d" option like:
	./singleitr -f ~/dtidata/normal/normal_s1.data -d ~/dtidata/normal/b0

. multiviewitr
	the multiple view DTI streamtube model render, it serves to visualize
	multiple DTI data models in a window.

	An example of the most commonly used scenario of this tool might be:
	./multiviewitr -f ~/dtidata/normal/normal_s1.data -f ~/dtidata/normal/normal_s3.data

    if you want to load more than two models once, simply use more "-f" options
	each indicating a model
	
	Each view will provide the same suite of functionalities as that of singleitr.

. multiwindowitr
	the multiple window DTI streamtube model render, it serves to visualize
	multiple DTI data models each in a separate window.
	
	An example of the most commonly used scenario of this tool might be:
	./multiwindowitr -f ~/dtidata/normal/normal_s1.data -f ~/dtidata/normal/normal_s3.data

	The functionalities are actually the same as that of multiviewitr

(To enable stereo rendering, use '-e' option when starting any of the above three executables)

There are detailed instruction on usage for each of these executables, triggered
by following the name of one of the executables with " --help " or "-h" option only.

2. How to Use this Tool
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All the three programs introduced above share the same usage as a fact of
matter, simply because of their same functionalities in terms of user interactions.

The user interactions can be divided into two groups as follows.

2.1 Keyboard Mapping

. alphabetic key response 
	- '9' Shading model switching
	- '0' for starting self-rotating exhibition
    - j/J for rotating clockwise around Y axis
    - l/L for rotating anticlockwise around Y axis
    - ,/< for rotating clockwise around X axis
    - i/I for rotating anticlockwise around X axis
    - h/H for rotating clockwise around Z axis
    - k/K for rotating anticlockwise around Z axis
    - Up arrow for translating upwards (on Y axis)
    - Down arrow for translating downwards (on Y axis)
    - Left arrow for translating leftwards (on X axis)
    - Right arrow for translating rightwards (on X axis)
    - 'z'/'+' for zooming in
    - 'Z'/'-' for zooming out
    - Home for resetting to original positions
	- 'q', 'Q' or Insert for quiting the program (close the window)

. specific response to visualization interaction
	'c' - switch between two coloring schemes, one is using the original colors
			provided in the input .data, separate color for each vertex; another 
			is to apply a uniform color randomly generated for all vertices,
			i.e. the direction color encoding.

	'g' - randomly change the uniform color mentioned above
	'd' - toggle between direction color encoding and uniform coloring
	'm' - alternating different direction color encoding schemes
	'v' - switch between two normal application scheme, one is using each vertex
			coordinate as its normal, another is to calculate a normal for each
			face and force the face normal for each of its vertices.
	'b' - randomly change border color of selection boxes
	'n' - next DWI image
	'o' - toggle DWI image embedding
	'p' - previous DWI image
	't' - toggle box-attached In-situ widgets

	'a'	- descrease transparency
	'A'	- increase transparency
	'r' - increase tube radius
	'R'	- decrease tube radius
	'x' - increase LOD (level of details of streamtube/superellipse meshes)
	'X' - decrease LOD
	'O'	- toggle Halo effect

	/* toying with superellipse */
	's' - toggle between streamtube and superellipse shape encoding
	'f' - toggle between wireframe and surface representation
	'1'/'2' - decrement/increment parameter 'a' in the superellipse equation
	'3'/'4' - decrement/increment parameter 'b' in the superellipse equation
	'5'/'6' - decrement/increment parameter 'N' in the superellipse equation


. function key response 
	Page Up          : dump info of the single(or the 1st) box as it touches fibers
	Page Down        : dump info of the single(or the 1st) box as it is away from any fiber
	F12              : save indices of currently selected fibers as they are in a same bundle
	F11              : save geometry of currently selected fibers
	F10              : enable/disable boxes
	F9               : save indices of selected fibers as they are NOT in a same bundle
	F8               : toggle box scaling limit
	F7               : toggle front face hint
	F6               : toggle orientation gadgets
	F5               : toggle synchronization(in multiview or multiwindow tool)
	F4               : remove the most recently visited box
	F3               : add a box by duplicating the most recently visited
	F2               : toggle associate pattern among multiple boxes (AND/OR)
	F1               : toggle interaction prompt text (if any such a text is loaded by 
					   using "-p" option).

2.2 Mouse Mapping

. when outside any box
	left dragging			- rotating all objects in the scene along X/Y axis
	CTRL + left dragging	- rotating all objects in the scene along Z axis

	right dragging			- zooming in or out all objects in the scene
	CTRL + right dragging	- translating/panning all objects in the scene
	SHIFT + right dragging	- scaling all objects in the scene
	right clicking			- active a short-cut pulldown menu for functionalities provided 
							  in the box-attached widgets when no box is present currently and the 
							  cursor is located at about the center of the window (the cursor will
							  change into a shape of cycle then)

	middle clicking			- switch light (when it is turned on, the light will be 
							  positioned at the mouse point at the same time)
	middle dragging			- moving light source on X/Y axis (for turning on the light only)
	SHIFT + middle dragging - moving light source on Z axis (for turning on the light only)

. when operating on a box
	left dragging			- pushing or pulling a sinlge face, the face hit now, if
							  dragging the face
							- pushing or pulling two adjacent faces, faces
							  intersect in an edge, if dragging the edge
							- pushing or pulling three faces, faces intersect at a vertex, if
							  dragging the vertex
							- positioning the newly added (cloned) box after
							  clicking on the "+" widget

	right dragging			- moving the selected box along X/Y axis if dragging
							  non-center region of any face of the box 
							- moving along Z axis if dragging any edge of the box 
							  (the same as CTRL + right dragging box)
							- congruently scaling the selected box in three
							  dimensions concurrently if dragging center region
							  of any face of the box
	CTRL + right dragging	- moving the selected box along Z axis
	right clicking			- (for clicking on one of face vertices only)
							  active a short-cut pulldown menu for functionalities provided 
							  in the box-attached widgets as an alternative to the widgets 

. when operating on a sphere
	left dragging			- panning (moving selected sphere along X/Y axis)	
	CTRL + left dragging	- moving along Z axis
	right dragging			- uniform scaling
	
2.3 Box-attached In-situ Widgets

Whenever the mouse cursor hovers over a box face, a set of widgets will pop up
and stuck to the face. Most commonly used functions related to the selection box
can be achieved with these widgets directly.

Widget will function when mouse is left-clicked and released both within the
boundary of the widget.

Currently offered widget function mapping:
	'+'('Add')				- copy this box/sphere to create a new one
	'-'('Del')				- remove this box/sphere
	'&'/'|'('OR'/'AND')		- toggle associate pattern among multiple boxes between AND and OR
	'a'/'e'('Sel'/'Rem')	- toggle selection mode between ACTIVE and EXCLUSIVE
	's'/'h'('Hide'/'Show')	- hide all boxes ( after all boxes are hidden, you can move mouse to
			  the center region of the window and active the short-cut menu by right clicking
			  and then choose the 'h' menu item, or you can simply press F10 )
	'c'/'n'('Ctx'/'NoCtx')	- toggle streamline context
	'r'/'b'('Excl'/'Brush')	- toggle brush mode

	/* available when DWI images loaded */
	'd'/'x' - toggle DWI b0 image embedding
	'>'		- move to next b0 slice
	'<'		- move to previous b0 slice

Other issues:
	How to add the first box or sphere?
	- right click near the central region of the rightmost boundary of the viewport to pop up a right-handed menu
	or, use the fixated drawn menu in the above region
