I:	How to select a ROI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although this is no fixed procedure to select ROIs in general with this tool,
there are certain tips on how to make full use of the selection boxes to choose 
target fibers.


1. use box with ACTIVE selection mode to pick out target fibers.

2. use box with EXCLUSIVE selection mode to kick out unwanted fibers.

3. use "Congrunt scaling" to quick narrow down the scope of selection.

4. use "streamline context" to retrieve the spatial relationship of the selected
fibers and its surrounding fibers that have been removed. Turn it off when the
context can obstruct your perception.

5. Use the "brushing" mode to make the box work like an eraser to wipe few unwanted
fibers.  Please also note with this mode:

(1) When in the "brushing" mode, any box can be safely deleted without
changing fiber selection status.

(2) If you made undesirable removal of fibers, the easiest way to get them back is
to switch off the brushing mode.

6. Note that box can be freely duplicated and removed. With multiple boxes, the
most commonly used setting is having some box in ACTIVE mode and others in
EXCLUSIVE mode.

7. Try to switch between the AND and OR pattern ( clicking '&' and '|' widgets )
if you find current pattern is not sufficiently helpful.

8. When boxes are too small to hold widgets, you can right click one of its
vertices to invoke the short-cut menu which contains equivalent functions to the
box widgets.


II:	How to save a ROI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

After finalize a ROI definition, please use following functions to save it.

1. Press F11 and F12 (the order does not matter) to save the bundle region.

2. [Optional step] Try to leave only one box that covers one end of the fiber bundle and then
press PAGEUP or PAGEDOWN. 

  * Here is a trick to leave only one box when there are multiple boxes to cramp
  * together a single fiber bundle: 
	(1) switch to "brushing" mode.
	(2) make a trivial move with each of the unwanted boxes.
	(3) delete the unwanted boxes one by another.
	Now you keep the fiber bundles still there and only a box left.
